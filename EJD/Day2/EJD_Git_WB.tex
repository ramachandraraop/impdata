\section*{State whether the following are True/False}
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep2pt
\item Version Control System keeps track of all old versions of files. [   ]
\item CVCS is independent on access to the server. [   ]
\item CVCS can be slower because every command connects to the server. [   ]
\item A git repository contains set of references to commit objects, called heads. [   ]
\item A head is simply a reference to a commit object. [   ]
\item The `git init' creates an empty git repository on the desktop. [  ]
\item Git internally holds a thing called the index, which is a snapshot of
your project files. [   ]
\item The `git clone' command makes a Git repository copy from a remote
source. [   ]
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Multiple Choice Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When using the git version control system, the concepts of working directory, index, and commit(s) are ubiquitous. Which of the following statements is correct?
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item A commit is a snapshot of any number of files. Thus, to save the current version of your working directory with git, all you need to do is to create a new commit.
	\item  As its name indicates, the index is simply a list of all previous snapshots. Thus, to save the current version of your working directory with git, all you need to do is to add it to the index.
	\item Saving the current version of your working directory with git requires two steps: add the files to the index, then create a snapshot based on the files listed in the index.
	\item Saving the current version of your working directory with git requires two steps: create a snapshot of the files in the working directory, then add this snapshot to the index.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Your working directory contains three files, named file1, file2, and file3. Which of the following commands will save the current version of your working directory with git.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item git init file1 file2 file3; git commit
    \item git init; git add file1 file2 file3
    \item git add file1 file2 file3; git commit
    \item git commit file1 file2 file3; git add
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  If you need to remove a file permanentaly from Git repository what command will you use?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Simply delete the file
    \item git rm \textless file-name\textgreater
    \item rm \textless file-name\textgreater
    \item remove \textless file-name\textgreater
    \end{enumerate}
    \item I want to experiment with branching, compare, and merge, and I want this to be private. How do I create the repository?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Clone a remote repository
    \item Create a repository on Github
    \item Create a local repository
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  When creating a local repository what location on disk should never be used ?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A shared folder
    \item A folder with no group access
    \item A folder under the Eclipse workspace
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  When should you commit changes from a branch to a product's master branch?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Whenever an error is found and a fix is made
    \item After review and testing
    \item Never, all work is done in task-based branches
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  When do you use the option to clone a repository?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item When you need to create a new local repository from a shared repository
    \item When you want to use xtUML editor to view a model in a shared repository
    \item Before creating a branch to perform a task in
    \item All of the above
