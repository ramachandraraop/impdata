\section*{State whether the following are True/False}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We can change return type of JUnit test method from void to some other type. [   ]
\item It is possible to pass command-line arguments to a test execution. [   ]
\item The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correctly. [   ]
\item Unit testing is commonly automated, but cannot still be performed manually. [    ]
\item To ensure testing robustness and simplify maintenance, tests should never rely on other tests nor should they depend on the ordering in which tests are executed. [   ]
\item Unit tests should be written without explicit knowledge of the environment context in which they are executed so that they can be run anywhere at anytime. [   ]
\item The most common approach to unit testing requires drivers and stubs to be written. [   ]
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Multiple Choice Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Internal and unit testing can be automated with the help of  \underline{\hspace{2cm}} tools.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Testing
\item Coverage
\item Scaffolding
\item None
\end{enumerate}
\item The exact scope of a unit testing is left to interpretation. Supporting test code, sometimes called  \underline{\hspace{2cm}} may be necessary to support an individual test.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conjucture
\item RemUnit
\item Scaffolding
\item All the above
\end{enumerate}
\item As a consequence, unit testing is traditionally a motivator for programmers to create  \underline{\hspace{2cm}} and  \underline{\hspace{2cm}} code bodies. This practice promotes healthy habits in software development.
\begin{enumerate}
\item uncoupled, uncohesive
\item decoupled, cohesive
\item decohesive, coupled
\item uncoupled, cohesive
\end{enumerate}
\item Select all unit testing frameworks.
\begin{enumerate}
\item ASUnit
\item ASPUnit
\item FCTX
\item MinUnit
\item All the above
