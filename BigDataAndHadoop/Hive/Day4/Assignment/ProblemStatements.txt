1) By taking a web log file,  Write a MapReduce program to aggregate the number of visits for each IP address. Write another MapReduce program to fi nd the top K IP addresses in terms of visits. These frequent visitors may be legitimate ISP proxies (shared among many users) or they may be scrapers and fraudsters (if the server log is from an ad network). Chain these two MapReduce jobs together such that they can be easily run on a daily basis.
